Questions:
* Push or pull?
* Update frequency?
* How often are the articles updated?
* Atom, RSS or XML-RPC?


### Push options

#### XML-RPC ping

### Pull

#### XML-RPC

#### RSS

#### Atom
There's an <updated> tag in the heading that we can use (please note that there also is another type of <updated> tag inside each content piece)



## Server side

Yoast SEO can add text at the end of the articles *when they appear in the atom/rss feed*. In the WordPress admin interface: Yoast SEO -> Advanced -> RSS
