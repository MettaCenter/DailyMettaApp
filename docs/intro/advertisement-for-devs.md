Hi!

The Metta Center for Nonviolence is looking for a programmer and a designer who want to be a part of a *free open source software* app project


### What the app does
The app will be called the **Daily Metta App**, it will present reflections on wisdom teachings and is based on the existing Daily Metta articles:
> Daily Metta is a daily reflection on the strategic and spiritual insights of Mahatma Gandhi (and in the future other wisdom teachers) in thought, word and deed. As Gandhi called his life an “experiment in truth,” we include an experiment in nonviolence to accompany each Daily Metta

You can find an archive of all Daily Mettas here: http://mettacenter.org/daily-metta/


### Project status

We are currently in the early phases of the project, working on the design and tech architecture. For more information about the project status please see our Github wiki main page: https://github.com/MettaCenter/DailyMettaApp/wiki
