Hi!

The Metta Center for Nonviolence is looking for software development volunteers who want to be a part of a *free open source* software app project from the beginning!

#### What the app does
The app will present reflections on wisdom teachings and is based on the existing Daily Metta:
> Daily Metta is a daily reflection on the strategic and spiritual insights of Mahatma Gandhi (and in the future other wisdom teachers) in thought, word and deed. As Gandhi called his life an “experiment in truth,” we include an experiment in nonviolence to accompany each Daily Metta

You can find an archive of all Daily Mettas here: http://mettacenter.org/daily-metta/

The app will be called the **Daily Metta App** and uses text from the Daily Metta. We are hoping to add more features to a mobile app or to the existing webpage (making it into a webapp)

#### Project status
We are currently in the early phases of the project and the features and platform has not been determined yet. We are conducting a survey with the people who have signed up to get daily emails with articles from Daily Metta to get input about features and platforms. We are also interested in what help and tips you could give us at this early stage in the project.

For more information about the project status please see our Github wiki main page: https://github.com/MettaCenter/DailyMettaApp/wiki

#### Websites
The organization behind the app is the Metta Center for Nonviolence: http://mettacenter.org/

All Daily Mettas can be found here: http://mettacenter.org/daily-metta/

The Metta Center also has a bi-weekly radio show Peace Paradigm Radio: http://mettacenter.org/writings-blogs/peace-paradigm-radio/

And our github page for the Daily Metta app is here: https://github.com/MettaCenter/DailyMettaApp/

#### Languages the project will be coded in
Unclear, but probably PHP (Wordpress) and Java (Android) will be used. We are also very interested in finding someone with experience in developing apps for iOS since this is knowledge we lack right now

#### Some of the people already involved
