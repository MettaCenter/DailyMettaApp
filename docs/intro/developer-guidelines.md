The idea behind the Daily Metta App comes from Stephanie and the Metta Center for Nonviolence which is a non-profit organization.


### Team communication

#### Email list: Google groups
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/metta-center-developers
This is where the "formal discussions" take place and where important decisions are made

#### Real-time team communication: Slack
https://mettacenter.slack.com


### How to report bugs

Please use [this template](https://github.com/MettaCenter/DailyMettaApp/blob/master/docs/bug-report-template.md).


### Decision process

* Overall design and architecture is determined by the people at the Metta Center for Nonviolence. We are using a so-called "benevolent dictatorship" structure where Stephanie and Michael have the final say, but we try to build concensus
* We want discussions about all decisions to be very open in the project and therefore, conversations that have started out as private can be made public without asking the participants (unless of course the conversation has been of a very personal nature)

People:
* Stephanie works at the Metta Center for Nonviolence and is the executive director there
* Michael also works at the Metta Center and is the founder of the organization
* Tord is volunteer coordinator and also himself a volunteer developer


### Volunteer responsibility

No responsibility for any damage.


### License

The Daily Metta App is free (and open-source) software. The license used is GPLv3.


### How to get an overview of the project

* See our [Waffle board](https://waffle.io/MettaCenter/DailyMettaApp)
* Go to [our wiki's Home page](https://github.com/MettaCenter/DailyMettaApp/wiki)
* Read the [advertisement](advertisement-for-devs.md) for new people
* Read the [readme file](../../README.md)
* For more details, please see the [Requirements specification](../requirements-spec.md)


### How development is done

* To start working, simply take [one of issues with the "ready" tag](https://github.com/MettaCenter/DailyMettaApp/labels/ready)
* All code commits are buildable
* We use [Android Studio and the Android SDK](https://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html) for development


### [Metta Center tech teams](https://github.com/orgs/MettaCenter/teams)

We have an "observers" (with read-only access) team here on GitHub for people either
* new to the project or
* not involved week-to-week

People in the observers group can still very much participate by - for example - forking the project and then do a pull reqest


### To speed up development

* We can assign issues to each other if we think the issue is suitable for the other person
* If we see little or no progress on an assigned issue we can send an email to the person who has the issue and ask if we can take it, and if the person doesn't respond within 48 hours we can take the issue
* We have an open conversation policy (see below) so that we don't need to ask each other about sharing emails with the whole group


### Open conversation policy

Unless conversations are clearly of a private nature, we can choose to share them with other team members. The reason for this policy is so that it does not take too long to relay information to others (otherwise the person who wants to relay information would need to wait for an email response from the person she has been in conversation with).
