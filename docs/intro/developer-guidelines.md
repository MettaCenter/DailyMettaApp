The idea behind the Daily Metta App comes from Stephanie and the Metta Center for Nonviolence which is a non-profit organization.


### Team communication

#### Email list: Google groups
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/metta-center-developers
This is where the "formal discussions" take place and where important decisions are made

#### Real-time team communication: Slack
https://mettacenter.slack.com



### How to report bugs

Please use [this template](../ways-of-working/templates/bug-report.md).


### Decision process

* Overall design and architecture is determined by the people at the Metta Center for Nonviolence. We are using a so-called "benevolent dictatorship" structure
* We want discussions about all decisions to be very open in the project and therefore, conversations that have started out as private can be made public without asking the participants (unless of course the conversation has been of a very personal nature)

People:
* Stephanie works at the Metta Center for Nonviolence and is the executive director there
* Michael also works at the Metta Center and is the founder of the organization
* Tord is volunteer coordinator and also himself a volunteer developer


### Volunteer responsibility

No responsibility for any damage.


### License

The Daily Metta App is free (and open-source) software. The license used is GPLv3.


### How development is done

* The issue manager asks someone who doesn't have an issue to pick one
* Alternatively, people simply pick issues themselves using [this guide](../ways-of-working/howto/finding-an-issue-to-work-on.md)
* [This directory](../ways-of-working) contains ways of working for programmers and other project roles


### Open conversation policy

Unless conversations are clearly of a private nature, we can choose to share them with other team members. The reason for this policy is so that it does not take too long to relay information to others (otherwise the person who wants to relay information would need to wait for an email response from the person she has been in conversation with).
