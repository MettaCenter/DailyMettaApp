The Daily Metta App project is an initiative to bring the already existing [Daily Metta articles](http://mettacenter.org/daily-metta/) to the Android platform. The **Daily Metta articles** are daily reflections on the strategic and spiritual insights of Mahatma Gandhi (and in the future other wisdom teachers) in thought, word and deed

## Appendix: Documentation conventions

### Reviewed and approved
The person who has written the document is included as a reviewer (she has reviewed her own document in a manner of speaking)

Some extra important documents, like for example the requirements specification and the developer guidelines require approval. The approval is written with the name of the approver and the date. If a document of importance is not approved it will say so close to the top of the document

### Document types

#### Text: Markdown
[Guide to markdown syntax](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)

#### Graphics: svg, odg and png
We try to use svg or odg when working with the files, and png when presenting. (Github supports displaying png, jpg and gif)

Images (both the original version and the bitmap version) are placed locally in sub-directories with the name "_img"

#### Other
* Audience is assumed to be technical
* External links are in italic
* All documentation is placed in the source tree (and more specifically under /docs), with these exceptions:
  * README.md - this file - is placed in the root of the source tree
  * Documents that change often - and that doesn't benefit from version control - can be placed in the wiki, for example:
    * Results of test cases that have been run
    * The wiki main page presenting the status of the project
